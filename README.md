# Landing Page for Mathagonal Circle

I created this project as a part of **[The Odin Project's Full Stack Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/)**.

## About the Project
This website is a landing page created using CSS and HTML for recreating the homepage for my math circle initiative's website [Mathagonal Circle](https://mathagonalcircle.org/).
